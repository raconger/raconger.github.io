Derek Sivers wrote yet another concise explanation on [Subtracting](https://sivers.org/subtract). It’s a concise variant on Ryan Holiday’s book [*Stillness is the Key*](https://dailystoic.com/stillness-is-the-key/). We require space and margin.

We know the answer isn’t more. More gear. More food. More time reading on the internet.

What is stopping you from breaking the pattern? 

Fear of the future unknown?

Fear of the embarrassment of putting yourself out there? 

The saccharine dopamine hit you get from other watching people doing things that you’d like to do?

Falling prey to your lizard brain and eating your feelings when life feels particularly stressful?

It’s curious that we react to feeling out of control by acting less in control. Without paying attention, it’s a sad downward spiral.
