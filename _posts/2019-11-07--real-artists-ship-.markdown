Do I consider myself an artist? No. By the time I finish [Linchpin](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1591844096/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_t1_Bj4WDb21YPQGG) I may change my mind, but I generally identify with being a person of action. But am I just lying to myself? 

As I found myself reading about yet another writing workflow and digital ecosystem, I felt the comfortable dopamine hit of pretending to do something by reading about others actually doing something. 

Then I read a bit more of Seth’s book and appreciated the simplicity of his message. The ones putting in the emotional labor have to actually _do_ something to contribute. They have to ship, like the Steve Jobs quote above. 

So I bought the domain. I set up the GitHub pages repo and forked a simple Jekyll blog. I copied someone's workflow to make it easy to post from anywhere. I started something. 

An old gym I used to follow had a similar message. It was:

> Talk - Action = Zero

So this is me taking action. Let's see if I can keep it up.
