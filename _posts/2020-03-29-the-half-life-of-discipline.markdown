Whether you believe in free will [or not](https://samharris.org/the-illusion-of-free-will/), you need to live with the results. Environment and habits will overcome discipline with time.

I go through various stages of motivation and in turn, discipline. Stealing from Bridgewater’s model of the economic machine and its short term and long term debt cycle, I do the same thing with my diet and exercise.

I’m currently in an inflationary period (measured by weight), so I attempt to correct this by slashing my budgets (a diet) or increasing utilization (exercise). What would have a better chance at creating change is increasing the near term cost of my over-indulgence.
